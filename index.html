						<p class='about__paragraph'>
							I started web development in 2016 with an online bootcamp. This is when I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I then learned to create responsive websites with Bootstrap and DOM manipulation with jQuery. While I no longer use these technologies, they have created a solid foundation for creating my own responsive breakpoints and manipulating the DOM. I then started another online course where I learned backend development with MongoDB, Express, and Node. I created a simple Facebook-like app to learn about RESTful methodologies. However, it was at this point I realized I favored the front end side of things and creating modern and clean websites with the user experience in mind.
							<br>
							<br>
							I went on to learn more about UX and UI design, practicing my front end skills while also reading books to supplement my learning. At this point, I felt very confident in my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and started my journey of learning JavaScript libraries such as Angular and React. With Angular, I created a bookmark manager called Bookly in which I learned the fundamentals of CRUD. Bookly can be found in my list of projects with a live demo available. Next up was React, with which I made a simple weather app designed to look like the weather app you would find on the mobile Google app. This can also be found on my portfolio. Nowadays, I have been working with clients creating websites for their businesses. This has given me real world experience working with clients and time management as I for once had to work with deadlines.
							My clientele work can also be found on my portfolio.
