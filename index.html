						<p class='about__paragraph'>
							I started web development in 2016 with an online bootcamp. This is when I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I then learned to create responsive websites with Bootstrap and DOM manipulation with jQuery. While I no longer use these technologies, they have created a solid foundation for creating my own responsive breakpoints and manipulating the DOM. I then started another online course where I learned backend development with MongoDB, Express, and Node. I created a simple Facebook-like app to learn about RESTful methodologies. However, it was at this point I realized I favored the front end side of things and creating modern and clean websites with the user experience in mind.
							<br>
							<br>
							I went on to learn more about UX and UI design, practicing my front end skills while also reading books to supplement my learning. At this point, I felt very confident in my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and started my journey of learning JavaScript libraries such as Angular and React. With Angular, I created a bookmark manager called Bookly in which I learned the fundamentals of CRUD. Bookly can be found in my list of projects with a live demo available. Next up was React, with which I made a simple weather app designed to look like the weather app you would find on the mobile Google app. This can also be found on my portfolio. Nowadays, I have been working with clients creating websites for their businesses. This has given me real world experience working with clients and time management as I for once had to work with deadlines.
							My clientele work can also be found on my portfolio.

					<h4 class="about__section-heading">More About Me (Feel free to read this but I know it's long)</h4>
					<div class="about__text">
						<p class='about__paragraph'>
							I was born in raised in New York City, which also means I'm a diehard Knicks fan (unfortunately; let's not talk about it). When I'm not pleading to the basketball gods for some help, I like to code, play video games, play basketball, skateboard, play the ukulele, or tinker with my mechanical keyboard collection.
							<br>
							<br>
							Since I was young, I've always been intrigued by technology and innovations. I was always playing video games or sitting at a computer, even making some of my own gadgets. I once used to aspire to be a video game developer. As I grew up, I became more intrigued in mechanical engineering and went to a high school with an engineering program. It was there where I explored my love for design and tinkering. In my engineering class, we learned 2D and 3D modeling with various programs. We also had a couple 3D printers which allowed us to bring our creations to life. I was always one to pay great attention to details. I however discovered my new love for programming when I joined my high school's robotics team. It not only allowed me another outlet for tinkering with mechanics but it introduced me to programming, allowing me to give life to my creations. 
							<br>
							<br>
							Our robotics team, the RoboWizards, went on to win the FIRST New York City FRC Regional in 2012 with our robot Lucy. For my Senior year project, I wanted to create something that would allow me to employ my passion for mechanics and made a 3D model of an excavator that actually worked with pistons, cables, buttons, and switches. Then with my new knowledge of programming, I was actually able to truly bring my creation to life. My 3D printed excavator then became a full fledge robot which could move and pick up materials with its bucket.
							Ever since then, I've had a love for programming and knew that that was the kind of career I wanted. As I continued on to college, I continued to explore my newfound passion for programming and became a computer science major. I was enthused by web development, especially front end because I enjoyed the idea of building something tangible that people could visit and interact with. Front end development seemed especially right for as I have always appreciated great design and attention to detail, whether that was a video game's UI, a marvel of mechanical engineering, or more recently, a website's simple yet functional UI.
							<br>
							<br>
							But anyways, that's me! Video gamer, basketball lover, tech enthusiast, tinkerer, once engineer and now aspiring web developer. This was pretty long, but thanks for reading!
