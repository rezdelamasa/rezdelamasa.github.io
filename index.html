        <p>Full Stack Software Engineer II</p>
        <h4>overview</h4>
        <p>
          Joined the Student team where we developed and maintained the built-in reader feature of our online eTextbook and Courseware platform, providing over 2M+ students instant access to all of their course material. A major highlight of my experience includes taking ownership of the development of a new Opt-Out feature that allows students to opt out of the semester's courseware plan if they decided to acquire the material themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another highlight is developing a greenfield project for a new product that enabled better self-service for professors by allowing them to submit requests for books and other material they want for their courses. This automated and streamlined a process that was previously manual and time-consuming for both the customer side and internal teams.
